# -Java-Decompiler-by-Moddy
Java decompiler created by me and open source.

## Features
- You can decompile class files much faster and safer.
- Generate commands with the data you enter so that you decompile manually.
- It will never execute a command without your consent.
- The run button only creates a file .bat with a command to decompile the files you want.
